#Fluid Simulation

## What is special in this "dev" branch?
* Without Effect11
* Using light computation rather than techniques in effect11.
  - Calculating reflection and refraction effect 
  -  Adding caustic effect (future)
* This is still in development and may be unstable
* If it gets a perfect result, I will merge it into "master"

## Environment
* Window 10
* Visual Studio 2015
* Direct X 11
* DirectXTK
